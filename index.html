                <p class="band__description"> 
                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                    from San Francisco, California. The band
                    consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
                    Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                    Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
                    band achieved its first commercial success as
                    an unsigned act, drawing attention from
                    manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                    other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
                    One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
                    confident the band could succeed even further,
                    pushing them to sign with Magenta Records. 
                </p>
                <p class="band__description">
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining
                    international recognition and ranking in the
                    top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                    immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                    and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                    one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                    acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                    themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                    their candid and authentic performances on
                    stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
                    The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                    second studio album, looking to be released in
                    late 2021.
